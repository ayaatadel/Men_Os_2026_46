HTTPS (HTTP)

How it works

Uses username + password

Now GitHub requires a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of password

Pros

Easy for beginners
Works everywhere (no extra setup)
Good for quick use or shared computers


cons

Asks for username/token
Less convenient (you must store token or enter it)



SSH

How it works

Uses SSH key pair (public + private key)

Once set up → no password/token needed


Pros

More secure
No repeated login
Best for daily development

Cons

One-time setup needed
Slightly confusing at first
